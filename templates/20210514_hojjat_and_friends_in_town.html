    <p>Day 4 and 5:</p>
    <p>Lost lake via Packwood lake trail, needs pnw forest pass</p>
    <p>The trail after mosquito lake was covered in snow. Some parts were sketchy traversing. Lost lake was all frozen but the view of the lake was super awesome. We camped at the lake and enjoyed the sunset. Snow shoe is highly recommended after mosquito lake. </p>
    <p>Ended up swimming in Packwood lake. </p>

    <p>Backpacking options (from Meryl):</p>
    <p>[Lake Chelan was great 17mile hike but ferry was all sold out]</p>
    <p>Lake Chelan is perfect for that... Hoh Rainforest, North fork Quinault River (likely snow free). Enchantments if you're a little crazy (full on scramble gear). Fourth of July Creek to Icicle Ridge and then along Icicle Ridge (Snowshoes, micro spikes). Rachel Lake/Alta Mountain (Not sure of conditions). Rainy pass to Snowy Lakes near Mazama (ice ax, crampons, maybe snowshoes). That's a start...</p>

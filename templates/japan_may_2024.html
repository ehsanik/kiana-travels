      <p>May 18</p>
      <p>This morning I spent a couple of hours organizing the next couple of days. I tried to go to the teamlab planets but booked out. It is a Saturday so that might be the reason, but in general it might be better to book in advance. I just didn't find it interesting enough. Instead I can to Tokyo tower 🗼</p>

      <p>May 20</p>
      <p>Left for hakone </p>
      <p>Tickets are 2500 and the express train takes 1:20 hr and normal one takes 1:40hr</p>

      <p>We stayed at Yumoto Fujiya Hotel</p>

      <p>(We had coordinated transportation)</p>
      <p>This was off season and we did through Fujinomia route. Gotemba is a good longer route and the yoshida is the worst and the most crowded. We saw maybe only 20 people total and it was beautiful. Early season Fuji highly recommended. Took a lot of breaks and an hour and half break at the summit. Total of 8 hours.

      <p>Imperial Palace and the garden, no entrance fee, highly recommended (one hour is enough)</p>
      <p>Be careful of hop bus being showed up on Google bus as a form of public transportation. Kinda a scam</p>

      <p>Start from the southern most point of the path </p>
      <p>Try green tea crepes! Yum!</p>
